# First-Project : A Spear Phishing simulation.

for this university project we have learned and worked on: 

- The implementation of a local chat group on command prompt "CMD" mainly using python Sockets module.

- Understanding the concept of Spear Phishing, Reverse Backdoors and Keyloggers and simulating their implementation on a victim machine " On some VMs".

- Packing python files using "Pyinstaller" so we can run the packaged app on the victim machine without installing a Python interpreter on it, adding data to the .exe file and changing it's icon.

- Using "UPX" to compress .exe generated files and help us mask the malware more.

- Discovered and learned about some obfuscation methods to trick the victim, the first one is the RTLO Attack that works by spoofing the malicious file extension by injecting the Unicode (U+202E) then sneaking .exe extension into it's name,the second one is by using Homoglyphs and tricking the victim eyes.
